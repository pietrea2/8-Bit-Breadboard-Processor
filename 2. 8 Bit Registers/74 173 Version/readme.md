## 74 173 Version of 8 Bit Register

The 74173 chip is a very good option for registers because it includes a Data Enable signal which controls if data can be stored in the flip flops, and an Output Control signal that controls whether the stored data is sent to the data bus.

This version is one of the best options to use when physically building a register on a breadboard because the data stored in the flip flops can be output to LEDs when an additional 74 245 Bus Transceiver is used to control the data output onto the main bus. Basically this allows you to see the data contents of the register at all times (using the LEDs) without having that data be output on the data bus.

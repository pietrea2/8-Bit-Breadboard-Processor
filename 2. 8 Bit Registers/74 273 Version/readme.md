## 74 273 Version of 8 Bit Register

The 74 273 chip compactly includes 8 D-Type Flip Flops in 1 IC chip (compared to only 4 in the 74 173).

However the drawbacks are that it does not include any Data Input or Data Output control signals. Data Input and Data Output functionality can still be added with the use of the 74 245 Bus Transceiver and adding a clock enable signal that acts as a "Data Input" enable.

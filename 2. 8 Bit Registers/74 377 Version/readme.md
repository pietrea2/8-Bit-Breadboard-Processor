## 74 377 Version of 8 Bit Register

The 74 377 is similar to the 74 273 but includes a Clock Enable signal (which I use as a "Data Enable").

This design is good if you only want to control data input. But it doesn't include data output control, therefore a 74 245 Bus Transceiver can be added for that function.
